                <h3 class="green">Family</h3>
                <p>Unknown. Kraken hasn't been found for a long time. Until now, people didn't find any animals that are similar to Kraken. So, it's hard to say which family it belongs to. Many believes it's the only one in its species.

                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>Attacking all the ships or human beings it meets using its electic energy balls. Most of the time it lives on the surface of the ocean, when it needs to sleep, it dive into the deep sea.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>It has a huge body occupied by its big single eye. On both sides of the body it has three tentacles, which it uses to grab things and swim. Also it has a yellow tail.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Very offensive when it meets ships</li>
                    <li>No certain area</li>
                    <li>Does not like land</li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Kraken?</span>
                People actually do not know a lot about Kraken. It suddenly appeared on the ocean and began to attack ships. Scientists are trying to track it and get a biological sample of it to do research. The current popular guess is that it is a mutant animal due to the pollution humans have made.

                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Any ships should stay away from Kraken, if you meet it, escape as fast as possible. It can create some unknown energy balls around itself or throw it to ships, please be very careful with that. Try to go to the land as Kraken does not like land.
